# AeroTech NView Hooker

the old AeroTech stage uses NView software to control it's motion, the software is very old and will only run in WindowsXP. The A3200 controller also requires special Firewire hardware to be installed, so it's quite hard to fit the software in a virtual machine like the Ensemble software.

Our solution is simply put the hardwares on a old desktop computer and hook every input on that computer to simulate a human input. Because the system and software are very old, they are vulnerable to virus and attacks, so the old computer is isolated from main network and a proxy program is the only way to access it.
